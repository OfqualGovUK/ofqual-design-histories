Applying to have your qualifications regulated is a serious undertaking for organisations. Ofqual's information requirements in order to gauge whether an organisation meets the Criteria for Recognition is large and requires organisations to complete multiple tasks related to the four criteria. These tasks can span months or even years of information gathering before being ready to submit to Ofqual. 

## Hypothesis

Breaking down the tasks in to a set of task lists with easy to use and understand progress indicators, which give users confidence to save and return to their application, will create a more user friendly experience and give users more confidence in the service. Resulting in a greater understanding of what is required to complete an applicatio and better quality applications with less errors.

This hypothesis is based on previous research in other Ofqual services, wider government research on the recently introduced task list patterns and components, and Human Computer Interaction theories like the goal-gradient affect and zeigarnik effect amongst others. 

## Next steps

- Unpicking the application structure between pre-application stages and application stages to ensure the removal of redundant entry for users.
- Usability testing task list pattern with users of the service. 
- Agreeing and setting performance metrics for the quality of applications and the task list performance. 
- Designing content and interactions at each task within the wider application task.
