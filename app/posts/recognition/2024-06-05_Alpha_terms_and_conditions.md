Reviewing the existing user journey in the existing service revealed a problem with duplication of terms, conditions and privacy notice content. Currently users are required to confrim on 3 different occasions that they have read the privacy notice, as well as agree to or consent to various other terms.

We want to ensure that any terms or conditions of using the service are placed up front to ensure transparency and to prevent the scenario where an organisation may spend time and effort compiling an application, only to not agree to some terms or conditions which may affect their ability to either become recognised or to complete an application. 

Documentation of the as-is user journey including screenshots and content is available on request. 

## Questions

1. What is the reason for the different privacy notices and multiple points of confirmation required?
2. What are the actual terms and conditions an organisation has to agree to, to continue using the service?
3. Are there any other eligibility or terms that should also go upfront in the service?
4. Is it enough to list these on the start page or do we need to get some form of interaction to confirm agreement or understanding?

## Approach

- Collaborate with subject matter experts in UCD, security, data protection, legal and recognition to ensure we capture all the requirements and user needs. 
- DPO to review privacy notice content.
- Explore need for an eligibility checking user flow
- Work with DPO and Recognition to reduce content to only what is required.

Documentation of all the existing terms and conditions, privacy notices and other information is available on request.

## Proposed solutions

- Include a single privacy notice which is available on the start page.
- Have a section of the tasklist (first section) dedicated to postive interaction with the terms and conditions of the application, and the privacy notice if required.

## Next steps
- Agree on legal and business requirements for privacy notice and terms and conditions.
- Confirm if we need a postive interaction with the content to confirm undertanding or agreement.
- Work with SMEs and content designer to create content that meets user and business needs.
- Continue to unpick and explore viability or need for of an eligibility checking flow.
- Test users understanding of content.
