What was included in the initial design was based on previous rounds of UR and stakeholder conversations. This is all gathered and prioritised here: [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPugcTl8=/](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPugcTl8=/)

Some areas had requirements that were not covered by the components in the design system. For these we did design research into other services, other departments design systems and looked through issues on the AlphaGov repo to find alternatives we could try. For most of these we needed to extend or change to suit our use case. The design research can be found here: [https://officequal.sharepoint.com/sites/IMTeam/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?ga=1&id=%2Fsites%2FIMTeam%2FShared%20Documents%2FProduct%20and%20Design%2FFigma%20exports&viewid=b6402f96%2Dc61d%2D4f95%2Db3e8%2D250047fe3d0d](https://officequal.sharepoint.com/sites/IMTeam/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?ga=1&id=%2Fsites%2FIMTeam%2FShared%20Documents%2FProduct%20and%20Design%2FFigma%20exports&viewid=b6402f96%2Dc61d%2D4f95%2Db3e8%2D250047fe3d0d)

## The initial design included: 

- account navigation 
- a way for users to view their application 
- a way for Ofqual to communicate with the applicant and vice versa
- status of the application 
- outcome of the application for each subject and specialism 
- a way for Ofqual to request more information from the applicant
- a place for Ofqual to provide feedback when the whole or part of application is rejected 
- a way for users to request updates to information in their account e.g. personal details, conflicts of interest
