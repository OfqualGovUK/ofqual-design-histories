## Providing a way for users to respond when they are rejected 
In the UR sessions some users have commented that if they felt the feedback was unjust they would want to respond and give further evidence if they had but didnâ€™t realise they needed to provide it in the application.

> "for the ones rejected. I would look at feedback, I would want the chance to respond and put in additional as it maybe you wanted something different or worded in a different way."

> "if I felt the feedback was unjust I would click on 'request changes'"

> "it would be useful to be able to respond to that. Looking back on the application I forgot to add this in or since the application I've done this."

> "I would at least potentially want to send a message to say 'what does not enough experience mean?'"

We thought about adding a link under the feedback (within the accordion) which would allow the user to send a message.

After talking with stakeholders and a discussion within the Product/Design team we have decided not to do this as it opens up too much potential for extra workload, which wouldn't be maintainable. If someone really wanted to get in contact they can send a message but we don't want to make it super easy for them to challenge an outcome of the application.
