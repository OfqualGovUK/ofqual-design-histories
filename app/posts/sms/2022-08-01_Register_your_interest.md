The Register your Interest form is intended to collect:
- registration details of potential applicants ahead of the full Experts application form going live 
- information on the routes and pathways that experts have expertise in to inform campaigning and advertisement in areas that do not have any/much coverage

It will be shared with anyone that we believe may have relevant VTQ teaching, assessment or subject matter expertise that we may meet at conferences, via LinkedIn, twitter, leaflets, flyers etc. This contact is required now, so that we have a bank of users ready to apply when the application form is released, and it allows the VTQ team to promote apply to provide expertise in advance.
