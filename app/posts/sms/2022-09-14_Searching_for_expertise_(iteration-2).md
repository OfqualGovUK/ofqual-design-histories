In round 1 of experts research we found that some participants didn't know if their area of expertise was within the sub categories we'd made, academic or vocational.

## What we did

We're now offering the applicant two different options to help them locate the areas they can advise in.

1. Search from a list of A levels, GCSE Ofqual subject groupings list, apprenticeships and T levels.
2. Search from a list of [tier 2 items from the Sector Subject Area Classification](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/types-of-regulated-qualifications/qualification-descriptions#sector).  

Many qualifications have a specific qualification type and level. For those that don't we are offering an "other" category. If an applicant selects an "other" category qualification, we need to then ask them about qualification type and level.      

We anticipate that the non-academic, industry/occupational applicants might not know a specific qualification and will choose to search by Sector Subject Area instead. Each awarding organisation must assign their qualifications to one of these sector subject areas so there is a relationship.

If an applicant chooses a Sector Subject Area we anticipate someone from Ofqual will need contact them to find out exactly what area they can assess though they will potentially be able to learn that from their profile alone.

## Next steps

We know that [Functional skills](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/functional-skills-qualifications-requirements) are currently missing from our searchable data set. Do we need to add these?

Overall, there are approximately 46,000 qualifications on the [Register](https://register.ofqual.gov.uk/), though if consolidated into cleaner titled, common clusters, there are approximately 15,000 qualifications. Do we need to extend out search to include these?
