Changes were made to the ID checks section, [the new flow is here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO7lK2KI=/?moveToWidget=3458764542812048029&cot=14) 

However, this section was not built into the live version for launch as there was a lot of discussion around how to do these checks internally and whether a third party system would be used. 

31 March update - a third party has been chosen and will be used post application. So nothing should change on the application for this.
