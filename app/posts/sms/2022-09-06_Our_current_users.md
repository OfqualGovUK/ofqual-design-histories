## About the Experts users

Notable patterns:

- some people have been commissioned far more regularly than others

## Predications on the number of users

We don't know any exact figures for the numbers of users we are expecting, but we are potentially looking in the thousands due to the number of qualifications that are coming up in the qualification reviews in which we need experts to cover. There are around 3000 qualifications in the level 3 qualification review, though some of these qualifications are closely related so will not require a brand new expert for each individual qualification.

## Additional stats 23 Jan 2023 

Application = application as an expert to the serviceAreas of expertise application = an application per subject/ area of expertise, so if you apply for 5 subjects, you will have made 5 areas of expertise applications.
