Closing the accordion under the application status by default

On the account 'Home' users were confused by the accordion being open under the ‘action required’ tag and tried to click on it to view information. This then closed the additional information and users didn't realise and wondered what to do next.

We have now closed the 'further info' accordion by default. 

This is also the same for applications that have been completely Rejected, where feedback is displayed instead of the 'Further information' accordion.
