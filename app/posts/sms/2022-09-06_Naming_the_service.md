## Are users only applying though?

There has been discussions around the use of the word "apply". For now it seems _ok_ to use it, but moving forwards, perhaps there will need to be consideration around future functionality of the app such as managing accounts and bidding and completing work, all of which do not feel directly related to the action of "applying". Will there be two services? One for applying and one for managing the account.

We've included questions about service names in both round 1 and 2 of experts research. The findings will need to be reviewed and discussed the the wider business.

Concerns have been raised about the use of 'experts' in the name of the service, as 'experts' is seen as an academic phrase.

There has been some evaluation done on the recruitment campaign, to the register interest, which can be found here:
