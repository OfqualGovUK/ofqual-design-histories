## User needs

As a user, I need to understand the terminology that Ofqual use for the [status] of my application

## Business requirements
Communicate outcomes with the applicant

## Overview/Context

User research round 8 revealed that a number of users felt the term "Rejected" was unsympathetic/harsh to use and potentially offensive. 

The term is used in status labels on the application-status and subject-status summary cards displayed on the home page of the account and and the detailed account status page.

## Analysis

The user research in round 8 shows that our users do use the term "rejected" themselves, however, some of our users clearly did not like the use of the term. Others were not bothered by the term used themselves but felt others may not like it.

Comments such as: 
- "Rejected, that's a bit harsh"
- "Rejected is not a particularly good word to be using"
- "Professional study of an area called rejection in terms of people and identity. I think approved is great but rejected would be a bit awful. I've been accepted for 3 but rejected for 10. Not a nice encounter at the end of your working day"
- Doesn't bother me. Rejected doesn't offend me but I can see it would offend some people
- "Rejected, it's a word, I don't find it too offensive but some others may"

One user suggested the term "Not accepted" instead. Users have used the term "unsuccessful" when discussing a rejected application or next steps. 

Note: Reviewing business process documents we also use the term unsuccessful in the current communications with applicants and renewal applicants.

### Other service analysis

There was a small review reaching out to other services to understand how similar services provided outcomes   and what feedback they might have received from users.  This analysis was through slack discussions with services: 

### Context provided:

Has anyone completed work where users are given a status of an application, i.e Approved, Rejected, Awaiting decision, Action required.  We are looking to change the 'Rejected' term, and are interested in what other term services may have been used.

Applicants can apply to be Subject matter specialists, they can be specialists in subjects or occupational areas, their application has to meet the criteria to be approved to work with us and if not their application is rejected.  Users have felt that the term 'Rejected' is harsh when they are already specialists but may not meet our specific criteria.

### Feedback

"I'd probably use language like "your application was not successful this time". But if it's purely for an internal system, I'd say 'rejected' is ok" (Cabinet office)

"I'd suggest unsuccessful in this context or not successful." (OFSTED)

"For an internal system, 'rejected' conveys "someone has already reviewed this application and updated the status". Something like "unsuccessful" doesn't quite have the same clarity." (Cabinet office)

"We use the term "Unsuccessful" after research showing users hated the term 'Rejected'" (DfE)

"We also use "unsuccessful" in our design" (DfE)

"on 'Apply for a National Insurance number', rather than saying 'your application was unsuccessful' or 'your application was rejected', we used:
'We cannot give you a National Insurance number because...'" (DWP)

## Decision

We have decided to test the term Unsuccessful in round 9 user research. Screenshots of changes:
![Screenshot of using unsucessful on home page](7.png)
![Screenshot of using unsuccessful on subjects page](8.png)

We considered using "Not Approved" instead of "Unsuccessful" but the label would be similar to the "Approved" label in skimming, especially where a user could not differentiate colours. 

We also considered using "Not accepted" but this term can have multiple meanings so "Unsuccessful" is the best place to start for testing
