The current application service is problematic. You can sign up for yourself to experience the adventure first-hand.

The following pain points are crowd sourced from internal stakeholders and members of the support team. 

## Current pain points

> Remembering the correct login details and logging in to the correct service! - often experts attempt to login to Recognition Gateway or The Portal, esp if they are also involved with an org using one of those Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) issues.
	 	
> Re-applying after rejection, can be a bit buggy and users ask us if things will be saved or if they have to start again from fresh

> Similar to above, completing the application in one go, is it saving progress? Or when progress hasn't been saved this can be frustrating

> Amending details, especially an email address - which is not possible, without developers migrating their account to a new one with a new email address and is not a great experience for anyone

> Renewal dates and how to renew - can be difficult to understand what they have to do by when and how!

> Device compatibility - using it on anything other than a chromium browser can be interesting

> Adding qualifications/certifications - having to add a new line to save the last one often stumps people - "i've selected it and it's there in the line, but it's not saving when I submit it!"
Same for other list/line addition fields like areas of expertise etc.
	 	
> Having to re-apply if anything is missing and is therefore rejected
> The biggest one of all. having to start from scratch if you application is rejected - even if it is because of a basic error / mistake / not quite  enough evidence.

> Timeouts and Auth Token expiry! - stuck having typed out all my answers and going to lose all that work

> Uploading files for evidence, Especially certified ID and certificates etc, users always 
forget to click the upload button once they've selected files.

> Uploading verified ID. More a flaw with the requirement than the design but applicants often upload things which aren't what we asked for. e.g. not verified, or not acceptable ID. Think we had a marriage certificate last year  

> Applicants do not seem to understand 'verified ID' as most of them do not send it verified, although this is not a technical issue the wording will need to be much clearer. We have had to reject a lot of applicants in the past due to this. Unfortunately that can mean that a lot of applicants will not re-apply as they have to complete the whole application again (apart from Personal details), and unless they have kept a copy of the information they would not have access to it after the application has been submitted. 

> The evaluation document once uploaded cannot be changed by the admin team, only the Dev team, so if there is something wrong with it we have to ask the Dev team to remove the old one and provide a new one for them to upload. Not all notifications work properly, example: we do not receive a notification for a new application if the applicant has previously applied.  Seeing the areas of expertise listed several times over with each level makes the form a lot longer than it need be. Unfortunately the way the system was built it had to be like this so we could partially reject if needed.  The ID does not always come through the system from an applicant when they have been rejected and are re-applying. We get a lot of applicants advise us they did this but for some reason it does not appear on our end. 

> One of the main things for our admin team is there is no area we can add notes which are not seen by the applicant. This can be quite difficult as we have 3 of us doing the same role and if there is a lot of applications we don't always know what is going on with an application. In these instances we have had to use a spreadsheet to keep notes and share between us which is not ideal.

> References not being in the system is not good, they are currently saved in Sharepoint. We send out an email to the referees and when they respond we check and save them in Sharepoint. They need to be all in the one system and not separate.  Also the feedback forms from commissioning managers are currently in the response chain which is not an ideal place as they can easily get lost in the message chain and no one would really know they were there. These are used at evaluation stage of the renewal process as well as by commissioning managers.
