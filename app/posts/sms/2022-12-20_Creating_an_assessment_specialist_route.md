Research uncovered a need for users to be able to apply when they don't have a subject they specialise in. Some people are assessment specialists, not linked to any subject in particular. Therefore a route needed to be created to bypass the subject selection. This was done with a details accordion on the subject search page:

This takes users through a different set of questions. If yes was answered, they are taken to that part of the subject selection. If no to both questions, they go to the assessment activities question. And then complete the section.

The Assessment experience section is added under the Evidence of experience heading on the application task list:

**Please note** this is not currently properly working in the prototype. And it hasn't been tested with users.
