The new flow can be seen here: [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO7lK2KI=/?moveToWidget=3458764542815414029&cot=14](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO7lK2KI=/?moveToWidget=3458764542815414029&cot=14) 

This was the flow that was used when the new application form launched. 

# Removing subject-sector split
UR showed confusion for users about whether to go down the 'subject' or 'industry or sector' route. We worked to combine that data so we could just have one list that was used in the dropdown on the subject search screen. This tested well in UR. 


# Swapping the order of types of expertise and areas of expertise 
Types of expertise came before areas of expertise. This caused a problem with tying the correct data together and ensuring the user answered the text boxes about their expertise in assessment, industry or teaching with evidence specific to the subjects they were applying for. So we swapped the order of these and asked the user to associate the type of expertise with the subject. 

**Note**: 'type of expertise' was later changed to use the phrasing 'type of experience' and 'areas of expertise' became 'Subject or occupational areas'.
