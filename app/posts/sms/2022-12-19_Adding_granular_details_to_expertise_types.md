Following conversations with stakeholders we worked out how applications were going to be evaluated and the granularity that information needed to be gathered in the application. 

This led to changes in the subjects and evidence sections. 
The checkboxes under Assessment and Teaching consolidated into 4 for each specialism (instead of around 10). For each of these we ask the user to provide evidence of their experience.
