This flow tested relatively well in round 2 of user research.

We've iterated to:

- Combined A/AS levels
- Linked expertise type to a selected subject/sector

The flow for this section is also [documented in Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO7lK2KI=/?moveToWidget=3458764537353425871&cot=14)

# What we've changed

## A and AS Levels  

We've combined A and AS level qualifications in the data set. As far as teaching experience goes, the levels are interchangeable. If you can teach one, you can teach the other. This has addressed a scenario  where an applicant might have to go through the select a subject flow twice to cover both A and AS level qualification.

## Linking "Types of expertise" and "Areas that you can provide expertise on"

In an earlier task we ask applicants to tell us if they have expertise in either:

- Assessment
- Industry or occupational
- Teaching, lecturing or training

In this recent update, once a subject or sector is chosen, we ask the applicant to link their expertise to this choice. This requires that they complete the "Types of expertise" section before they begin the "Areas that you can provide expertise on" section.

New question in flow:

## Next steps

We currently have a fancy way for applicants to search/filter results when selecting an industry or sector. The vast majority of users in research completely ignored the search and scrolled through the radios instead. The few that did where not able to find what they were looking for via the search anyways.

Removing search and reverting to a REALLY long list of radios is probably the preferred option. It will be cheaper to build and more accessible too.

This screen needs to be simplified. ðŸ‘‡
