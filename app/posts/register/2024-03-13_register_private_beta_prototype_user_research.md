  title: User research for private beta prototype of the Register
  date: 2024-03-13
---

User research was undertaken on the prototype for the private beta of the Register of Regulated Qualifications in February 2024.

The findings of this research will be used to make final changes to the prototype ahead of a private beta test with Ofqual staff.

## Research objectives and methods

The objectives of this round of research were to test:

* user journeys and features that were altered as a result of the last round of user testing:
    * qualification and organisation search without autocomplete
    * an improved interface for comparing qualifications
    * improved display of filters for search results
* display of an organisation's scope of recognition (the qualifications it is regulated to offer)
* user preference for 2 differing designs of error page
* preference for the term used to describe the organisations we regulate

The research method was semi-structured remote interviews with 9 participants who were awarding organisation employees, Ofqual staff, students, further education staff or software consultants.

Individual interviews were conducted in 2 stages. First, participants were asked about their roles and experience with qualifications data. The second part of the interview focused on usability testing and gathering feedback on the services being tested.


## Themes

### Find a qualification

All 9 users were able, without prompting, to successfully use the search function to find a qualification.

All 9 users were comfortable using the filters and were able to identify how they would be used to refine their results.

#### Feedback

"Headings make sense."

"Categories are very clear."

"Assessment methods [are] really helpful."

"This is different, have everything all on one page."

"All the links work – impressive."

"Qualification fee – nice to have."

"Interested in guided learning hours."

"Information I'd expect to see under 'regulatory' is [the] last date for new starters."

"It would be helpful to have information on [the] last date for new starts for qualifications that are currently available.

"With the current there is a lot to scroll through."

#### Feature requests

Some features that users suggested would be helpful to them included:

"Interested in funding information. Is it available? How much [detail] will I get?"

"It would be helpful to link through the apprenticeship standard to the 'Find an apprenticeship' service."

"Funding value [is] also important information."

"With all the reforms [it] would be useful to link to OCC maps."


### Compare qualifications

All 9 users were able, without prompting, to successfully select 2 or more qualifications to compare. Only 3 users selected more than 2 qualifications to compare.

8 of 9 users were able to identify the purpose of the 'differing information' section at the top of the page.

#### Feedback

"Yeah, this is great, being able to see things side-by-side. This is really, really useful. Would be super useful. [I] Would definitely use this feature to compare guided learning hours."

"I guess I can do 3? [It] Should say compare 2 side-by-side. [It] Would make it more obvious."

"Useful feature. Really smart that is is able to pull out the differences."

"The differences [sic] information, the way it is shown is really obvious."

"It is good to have the differing information at the top rather than having to scroll for it."

Some users thought that repeating the differing information at the top of the page, as well as it being in the full details further down the page, might be confusing. These users suggested highlighting the differing information in a different colour instead.

One user said that the fact that the qualification titles were different yet not included as part of the 'differing information' section was odd.

### Change compared qualification

8 of 9 users were able to change the compared qualification from the 'compare qualifications' page.

6 of 9 users were able to intuitively change the qualification.

1 of the users did not notice the link and went back to the search results page to change the qualifications to compare.

#### Feedback

"This is clever. I can change a qualification and compare a qualification side-by-side, all in one place!"

### Find an awarding organisation

All 9 users were able to successfully find an awarding organisation without prompting.

#### Feedback

"Categories make sense."

"Information is useful."

"Helpful to have 'known as'."

"How would you search for less-known awarding organisations?"

"Details page is ok. Tells you everything about them. Don't think you need anything else, maybe phone number?"

"Search results page really helpful, especially the colour coding of the recognition status."

"Green button to find all qualifications is really useful."

### Terminology for regulated organisations

The existing service is inconsistent to how it refers to organisations regulated by Ofqual. We presented the participants with 4 terms and asked them to choose which of the 4 they would use to refer to an organisation regulated by Ofqual:

* awarding organisation
* awarding body
* exam board
* regulated organisation

5 of 9 users would use the term 'awarding organisation.

4 of 9 users would use 'awarding body', but all 4 also recognised that the industry-preferred term is 'awarding organisation'.

#### Feedback

"Awarding organisation is the preferred term. It's the term we use in the awarding organisations I've worked in."

"'Awarding organisation' [is] used naturally in conversation/ Might call them a 'certificating body'."

Users also pointed out that 'exam board' could be misleading as not all qualifications are examined.

One user stated that they would use 'exam board' when talking to stakeholders, but that it was not precisely correct to do so.

### Scope of recognition

All 9 users understood what the scope of recognition is.

8 of 9 users were able to successfully interact with and expand the list.

#### Feedback

"Minimise the clicks – unnecessary and time consuming, which can be frustrating for teachers."

"Useful feature for those providing information to students, e.g. career advisor, if they know how to use it."

"'Other' are vocational qualifications. Would be better titled as 'VQs'."

"Why is 'Entry level' in 'Other', it seems like kids doing entry level [qualifications] are shoved down at the bottom."

"'Other' suggests that it is lesser but there are lots of qualifications that will sit in there but could be missed, especially by those who do not use the register regularly e.g. curriculum managers may not know where to find these qualifications quickly nor may they expect to find them in other."

"Only worry about [the CSV] download is that it may not be up to date."

"[Put a] Number at the end in brackets to show how many are in each category."

"Unregulated should be categories similar to recognised (same groupings - types of qualifications)."

## Error pages

2 designs were shown to users, error page A had a red error box at the top and error page B didn't.

For find a regulated qualification:

* 6 of 9 users preferred design A
* 3 of 9 users preferred design B

For find a regulated organisation:

* 5 of 9 users preferred design A
* 2 of 9 users preferred design B
* 1 user wanted a combination of both

We observed that users may have chosen their preference based on the wording of the error message rather than the design.

## Recommendations

1. For the scope of recognition, the CSV download should be tabulated data with the option to sort and filter the data.
1. Some of the wording needs further consideration.
1. Merge the qualification sub-level into qualification level within the filter options.
1. Consider again the naming of the category 'other' in the scope of recognition.
1. Refine the design for changing qualification within the 'compare qualifications' journey.
1. Ensure that error pages are clear.

## Next steps

1. Refine the prototype.
1. Develop the functioning services.
1. Launch a private beta for testing with Ofqual users.
