  title: User research for alpha prototype of the Register
  date: 2023-12-20
---

User research was undertaken on the alpha prototype of the Register of Regulated Qualifications between September and November 2023.

The findings of this research will be used to steer the development of the beta prototype with user testing scheduled to take place in January 2024.

## Research objectives and methods

The objectives of this round of research were to:

* understand how the improved features of the Register, including search options and comparing a qualification, enhance users’ experience 
* gain feedback from users on the improved design of the Register; to understand what improvements can be made
* understand users’ preference for comparing a qualification  (multi column or two column) feature in regards to usability
* gain an understanding of how our users understand and make use of the information and data they are provided with on the Register

We used mixed methods which included semi-structured interviews and card sort activity.

Individual interviews were conducted in 2 stages. First, participants were asked about their roles and experience with qualifications data. The second part of the interview focused on usability testing and gathering feedback on the Register service (front end).

The card sort activity indicated 102 responses – split between internal colleagues and external participants, mainly from other government departments.

## Themes

### Find a qualification

#### Search page

The autocomplete search box with drop-down results was confusing. Some users ignored the function completely and continued to type the full name of the qualification they wanted to find.

#### Qualification details page

Some users indicated that they would like the funding link (which links off to the DfE's qualification search service) to take them straight to the results page of that service.

It was indicated by some participants that they would like information on progression routes for a qualification. This would allow them to get a long-term perspective and make strategic decisions about qualification choice and curriculum planning.

### Information architecture

#### Ordering

Participants indicated specific fields that they would like placed more prominently on the page.

#### Acronyms

Acronyms should be explained or expanded. In particular, users were uncertain what the term 'EQF' meant. There was a suggestion that qualifications should be linked to descriptions of those qualifications.

#### Titles

Some of the language in qualification titles was ambiguous to the user. 'End-point assessment' was one singled out by participants.

#### Language in general

Participants found some of the language used to be ambiguous. Particular points raised were:

* around the qualification availability 'available to learners' – does this mean that qualifications could be available to some learners but not others?
* about the terms 'CCEA', participants did not know that this was the regulator in Northern Ireland
* it was not clear whether the fees information referred to fees to the school or fees to the learner

## Card sorting

Card sorting was undertaken both with internal Ofqual staff and external users recruited from other government departments. The aim was to gain understanding of the categorisation and prioritisation of different fields from the qualifications details.

### Notes for the tables

In the following table, the column headings show the categories that users sorted items into and the row headings are the qualification data fields. The data in each cell indicates the number of participants who ranked the qualification data field in that particular category. Blank cells indicate that no users placed the data field in that particular category. Note that the tables scroll horizontally to reveal the full data.

## Specific user journeys

### Compare qualifications

Summary findings from the qualitative user research were as follows.

1. The drop-down menu for choosing which 2 qualifications to compare makes it a lot easier to navigate between qualifications.
1. The qualification titles are too long and you can only read the full qualification title once you have expanded the drop-down box and selected the qualification.
1. The multi-column display was confusing – users selected multiple qualifications but could only see 2 displayed as the rest were hidden by horizontal scrolling.
1. Only one user discovered that they could scroll horizontally to see more qualifications to compare.
1. Users expect there to be an upper limit on the number of qualifications they can compare when viewing more than 2 qualifications.
1. The multi-column comparison was difficult to use for comparison as the column and rows headings kept scrolling off-screen.
1. There was a need expressed to be able to download the selected qualifications to later perform offline comparison.

### Find a regulated awarding organisation

There were specific points raised by individual participants:

* the 'scope of recognition' is the most important information
* further categories are needed for vocational qualifications, particularly the SSA information
* fee information is ambiguous, is that tuition fee or exam fee?
* a user did not understand that the 'scope of recognition' entries were clickable

### General usability

Statements from users included:

> Tells you what you are doing, for example, 'Find a qualification', 'Find an awarding organisation', 'Compare a qualification'.

> Straight forward, easy to navigate.

> In boxes, not too wordy.

> Clear, easy to understand.

## Feature ranking for comparing qualifications user journey

Participants were asked to rank which qualifications data was most important to them when making comparisons between qualifications. The data was analysed in 5 user groups as detailed below.

### Notes for the tables

In the tables, participants ranked the data on a scale from 1 (most important) to 7 (least important).

Note that the table may scroll horizontally to reveal the full data.

## Recommendations

1. Refine the search functionality by removing autocomplete. Users should be able to manually search for qualification or awarding organisation.
1. Avoid the use of acronyms. If using an acronym is unavoidable, defined it for the user.
1. Consideration to be made around the ordering of information, for example, most useful information to be presented at the top of the screen.
1. Consideration to colour code  qualifications that are available and unavailable – this would allow users to easily identify available qualifications.
1. Explore a way to indicate to users that CCEA data is for qualifications in Northern Ireland only.
1. In the 'comparing qualifications' user journey, include text to expose similar qualifications to the ones they had selected.
1. Include functionality that allow users to download qualifications search results for later, offline use. 
1. Include functionality that allows users to select the data fields they wish to use to compare qualifications, and only display that information on the comparison screen.
1. For scope of recognition, indicates to users that the list is clickable and is able to be expanded.

## Next steps

1. Continue user research to build, refine and implement new features.
1. Undertake user research to test if the language used meets the needs of each of our user groups.
1. Test the accessibility of the interface with disabled users who use a variety of access methods to interact with the website.
