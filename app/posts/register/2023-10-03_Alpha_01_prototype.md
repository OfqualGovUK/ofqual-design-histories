The first Alpha version of the Register is delivery of basic API functionality, however it is not easy for stakeholders to visualise.

It was decided that as part of this alpha, prototypes for the 3 major user journeys would be produced:

- find a regulated qualification
- find a recognised awarding organisation
- compare qualifications

## Design notes
